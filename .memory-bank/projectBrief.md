Koyote POS is a local-first Point of Sale system for a physical Trading Card Game store. The foundation focuses on a fast, reliable checkout experience that works without cloud dependencies and keeps store data on-device.

## Goals

- Keep data local with a SQLite-backed domain layer.
- Enable an Electron desktop wrapper for offline-first operation.
- Provide a clear AI Memory Bank to persist decisions and context.

## Non-Goals (Initial Foundation)
- No authentication or multi-tenant support.
- No external APIs or payment processor integrations.
- No full business logic implementations yet.

## Audience
Store owners, managers, and staff operating a TCG retail counter.
